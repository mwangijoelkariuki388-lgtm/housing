  main.py — FastAPI Application Entry Point
  =====================================================
  This is the file you run to start the server:
      uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8000

  It creates the FastAPI application, registers:
  - CORS middleware (so the frontend can make requests)
  - API routers (listings, cities, contact)
  - Static file mounts for uploaded images and frontend files

  APPLICATION LIFECYCLE:
  When the server starts:
  1. lifespan() runs → database tables are created
  2. The server starts listening for requests

  When a request comes in:
  1. FastAPI matches the URL to a route
  2. Runs middleware (CORS checks)
  3. Calls the route function
  4. Returns the response

  STATIC FILE SERVING:
  FastAPI serves our frontend HTML/CSS/JS files directly
  using StaticFiles. This means we don't need a separate
  web server like nginx for development. The frontend is
  served at http://localhost:8000/ and the API at /api/...

# ===================== CORS MIDDLEWARE =====================
# CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) controls which websites
# can make requests to our API. In development, the frontend and
# backend are on the same domain (:8000), so CORS isn't strictly
# needed. But it's good practice to have it for future use
# (e.g., a separate mobile app or different domain).

# Register our three API routers.
# Each router has its own prefix defined in the router file.

# ===================== STATIC FILES: FRONTEND =====================
# Mount the entire frontend directory at "/" (root).
# html=True means index.html is served automatically when
# a directory is requested (e.g., "/" serves frontend/index.html).
# This is how our SPA shell gets loaded.
